# BankStatementAnalysis

## Project Description
The Personal Finance Dashboard is a sophisticated tool designed to offer a comprehensive analysis of personal bank transactions over multiple years. The goal of the project was to utilize the advanced language processing capabilities of Ollama Llama2 LLMs to categorize transactions from bank statements, which were then visualized using Plotly to provide a clear, interactive financial overview for the years 2023 and 2024.

## My Contributions

### Data Categorization
- **Action**: Implemented a system to read bank statements from CSV files and used Ollama Llama2 to automatically categorize transactions, saving time to analyse the expenses.
- **Outcome**: Achieved an organized dataset where expenses and income were categorized into distinct segments, such as 'Food and Beverages' and 'Entertainment', simplifying the visualization process.

### Data Integration and Visualization
- **Action**: Merged the categorized data with the original dataset, leveraging Plotly to develop a user-friendly dashboard that clearly outlines income and expense data.
- **Outcome**: Created a dynamic visual representation of financial trends, including a detailed month-by-month income and expense report, which empowered better financial tracking and planning.

### Interactive Dashboard Development
- **Action**: Designed and deployed the Personal Finance Dashboard to display categorized financial data in an interactive format.
- **Outcome**: Provided a holistic view of financial health, showcasing a total income for 2023 and 2024, highlighting key spending areas across both years.
